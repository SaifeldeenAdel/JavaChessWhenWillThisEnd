Undo Move:
- Just add a moveHistory stack to our ChessGame and an undo method, storing board states because moves will take way too long

Design Pattern ideas:
- PieceFactory - returns an object of a Piece based on the given parameter
    Usage in Board
        --> pieceFactory(PieceType.PAWN) return Pawn
- PieceMoveCommand - has execute and undo move methods
    Usage in ChessGame
        --> inside move, we can just create a MoveCommand object passing the square to and from and the board, then calling its execute method.
        --> helps in encapsulating the move implementation in ChessGame and moving it to another class
